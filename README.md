# NewsMania
NewsMania uses newsapi.org to fetch news from your country. It shows a list of headlines, and clicking on one takes you to the news website.


The app is built using MVVM architecture and Kotlin Coroutines. Whole UI written in Jetpack Compose with day/night theming support. Uses Room DAO for caching news items

This app is made with Kotlin and Android Studio IDE where I fetch data from the https://newsapi.org/ API and and load in Recycler View. I also add a function for ADVERTISE, whenever we swipe 5 news page, we will get ads.

Libraries used in this project -

- Retrofit 2
- Jetpack Compose
- Room
- Kotlin Coroutines
